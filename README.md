# 🧠 10T SRAM Layout Design

This repository contains the design and layout of a **10-transistor (10T) SRAM cell** optimized for **low power consumption**, **high stability**, and **enhanced performance**, implemented using **Cadence Virtuoso** with the **GPDK 90nm** technology node.

## 📘 Overview

Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) is a key element in SoC design. Conventional 6T SRAM cells face stability and leakage challenges at low supply voltages. This project introduces a **10T SRAM cell** architecture with **separate read and write paths**
